This is a demo website for an interior consultant. The website follows the design specifications from here: [Design](https://www.figma.com/file/3cf83hHRBAGjG5EKPcG2bV/interior-consultant-challenge?node-id=1%3A4).

The following are the challenges I solved in order to create the website:

- Creating a responsive website
- Implementing a drawer navigation on devices with smaller screen widths
- Positioning an item relative to its parent using absolute positioning and CSS transform's translate property
